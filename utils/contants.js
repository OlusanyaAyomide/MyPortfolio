Although I also enjoy working on the server-side, I am constantly intrigued to see how things work under the hood. I have always been fascinated by building things from the ground up. This drive led me to learn block programming back in 2021. I quickly realized that I needed to do something more advanced and programming-like, so I started learning my first programming language, which was Python, also in 2021.
